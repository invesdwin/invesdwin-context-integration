[BUG] (runtime): the SLURM launcher did not work properly when the node list contains hostnames with leading zeros
[BUG] (ibvdev): fixed the issue when sending an MPI.OBJECT datatype using the Sendrecv operation for multiple times
[BUG] (ibvdev): fixed the bug related with the unexpected event RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED when using the RDMA CM connection method

[CHANGE] (runtime): the fill-up strategy now makes a more balanced allocation of processes for some specific cases
[CHANGE] (mxmdev): this device has been updated to MXM 1.5 API. The support for older (and buggy) MXM versions has been dropped in this release (e.g., MXM 1.0 and MXM 1.1)
[CHANGE] (ibvdev): removed the requirement to set IBVX_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables
[BUG] (ibvdev): manual selection of the RDMA device did not work properly when more than one device was available
[BUG] (mxmdev): fixed the connection establishment flow
[BUG] (niodev): the JVM did not terminate when an exception was raised from the MPJ application after MPI.Init


Version 1.0_4 - July 18, 2013

[CHANGE] (ibvdev): improved the detection of the maximum data size that can be sent "inline"
[BUG] (mpi): fixed a bug in Gather and Scatter collective operations
[BUG] (ibvdev): fixed the issue that causes some applications to fail in "ibv_post_send" when using the "inline" feature
[BUG] (ibvdev): the connection setup using the RDMA CM API did not work properly


Version 1.0_3 - June 4, 2013 

[NEW] (examples): added new MPJ example programs (examples directory): Ring, MatrixMatrixMult, MatrixVectorMult and NumericalIntegrationPi
[BUG] (mpi): fixed a bug in MST-based algorithms for Gather/Gatherv and Scatter/Scatterv collective operations

[NEW] (runtime): added wmiconf.bat script (bin directory) to help configure WMI
[NEW] (runtime): added fmpjd.vbs script (bin directory) for the manual execution of the daemons in Windows OSs (in addition to fmpjd.bat)
[NEW] (runtime): added OS name and version info when starting MPJ applications
[NEW] (runtime): added -tag-ouput option for fmpjrun/fmpjexec commands
[NEW] (runtime): added -env option for fmpjrun/fmpjexec commands
[NEW] (runtime): now the runtime tries to abort the MPJ application when one of the ranks fail
[NEW] (runtime): added an specific runtime configuration file (conf/runtime_win.properties) for Windows OSs to avoid enconding issues

[CHANGE] (runtime): reduced the amount of the overhead incurred for handling the I/O of the processes launched by the runtime
[CHANGE] (runtime): "fmpjBoot" parameter in conf/runtime.properties has been replaced by "fmpjBootstrap", which allows to select the launcher to use (auto by default)
[CHANGE] (runtime): FastMPJ daemons try to destroy local MPJ processes on exit
[CHANGE] (runtime): fmpjrun/fmpjexec commands don't use "machines" as default value for -machinefile (or -hostfile) option
[CHANGE] (runtime): updated fmpjd.bat script. The ComSpec variable is read to get the location of the cmd.exe command in Windows OSs
[CHANGE] (runtime): updated the runtime scripts (fmpj*) located in bin directory in order to use the fmpj-env and fmpj-env.bat scripts
[CHANGE] (ibvdev): properly detect of FDR10 and FDR OpenFabrics devices
